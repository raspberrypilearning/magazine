## Another page

Add another page to your magazine website.

--- task ---

Add a new page to your project and name it `page2.html`:

--- /task ---

+ Page 2 will be quite similar to the first page of your magazine so you can copy the html from `index.html` and paste it into `page2.html`.

Notice that both pages use the same `style.css` so they will share styles.

+ Change the `<h1>` title for page2:

+ Now you'll need links between your pages so you can get to page 2 and back to the front page.

Go back to `index.html`. Add a link inside a div in column 2 in `index.html`:

+ Test that you can click on your new link and move to page 2 of your magazine.
