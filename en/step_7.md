## What can you do now?

If you are following the [HTML & CSS: Module 2](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/webdev-module-2){:target="_blank"} pathway, you can move on to the [Pixel art](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pixel-art/){:target="_blank"} project. In this project, you will create a pixel art editor.

--- print-only ---
