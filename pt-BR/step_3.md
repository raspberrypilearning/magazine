## Criando colunas

Websites often use multiple columns. Let's create a two column layout for your magazine.

+ First create two column `div`s.
    
    Add the highlighted HTML to `index.html`:

+ Now style the column divs so that one floats to the left and the other floats to the right.

    Each column is less than 50% so there's room for padding.
    
    You'll need to add something to a column to see the effect.

+ Let's add a kitten picture to the top of column 2.

    Notice that the kitten image is positioned about half-way across the page, in the second column.
    
    It's a bit big though!

+ Let's use `max-width:` to make images fit within their container.
    
    Add the following style to `style.css`.

    This will apply to all images you use in your magazine, not just the kitten.

+ Now add a class `photo` to the image so that you can style it:
    
    ![captura](images/magazine-photo.png)

+ And style the image to add a shadow and a twist to make the photo pop out of the page:

    Make some changes until you like the result.
